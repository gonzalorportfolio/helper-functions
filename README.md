# Helper functions

In the intricate world of coding, a helper function emerges as a silent ally, aiding developers in their quest for efficient and organized scripts. Simply put, a helper function is a reusable snippet of code designed to perform a specific task, assisting in keeping your main codebase DRY.

Now, let’s unravel the mystery behind the term “DRY.” In the realm of programming, DRY stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself.” It’s not just a catchy acronym; it’s a fundamental principle that advocates for avoiding redundancy in code. Whether you’re a seasoned developer at Google or just starting out, this principle is a universal truth acknowledged in every coding corner. Picture it as a wise old sage whispering, “Why say the same thing twice when once will suffice?”

In this repo you'll find links to detailed explinations on how and why these functions are helpful and how they work. If you just want the code thoes will also be avaiable as well. 

Happy coding!
